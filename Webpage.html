          <h1>My first desktop PC</h1>
          <p>When I was a teenager, I went to a store and told an employee I was looking for a PC I could play games on.
            he pointed me to a "<span class="bold">New</span>", out-of-date HP desktop with an integrated graphics cpu
            and
            assured me, "this is the
            <span>absolute best</span> system for you!". Of course, I was naive and took him for his word. Everybody
            loves
            an honest salesman, anyway... $550 and an ignored receipt later you could probably imagine how confused I
            was
            when I tried to play <span class="bold">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</span>, a very well optimized game
            made in 2012, and it ran at 16 frames per second on the lowest setting, I was devistated... Bitterness
            aside,
            having this
            "paper-weight" opened me up to modifying save files in my console games, which lead to experimenting with
            softwares I found interesting or useful, and naturally, being naive, making mistakes that would give my
            computer viruses, or conflicting driver issues, which in turn I would try to fix myself. Searching google,
            trial and error processes, trying to find the answer to a question that hasn't been answered yet by using
            the
            solution to another problem to lead you to a similar fix, all the awesome troubleshooting stuff. If you make
            enough mistakes deep enough in your file explorer it turns out, you need to reinstall your operating system
            entirely, nothing is more confusing than downloading linux with no true reason to do it having only known
            microsoft as an operating system. Needless to say, that didn't last long being a kid that for the most part
            just wanted to game on the PC.

          <p>And I wasn't just going to throw my money at the first thing this time, because with a great search engine,
            comes great results. Who'd have thought?... After some research on how to compare components, I found
            <a>userBenchmark</a>. (I highly reccomend if you want to see a heirarchy list of components' average
            performance) and used it to compare prices of similar parts reccomend by people online for the types of
            games I wanted to play, this let me make a budget and buy my computer peice by peice while working at my
            line cook closing job. It took about 7 months to get all of my parts, but after re-seating my RAM for the
            third time I set my bios to run my RAM in XMP profile, booted my uefi drive, installed windows and read the
            fabled "Hello" message

          <p>Okay, I can play any game I want at max settings, but the games are getting boring, and learning more about
            the limitless potential what could be achieved with something that looks as simple as a rock is so much more
            appealing. But when you're looking at it from the outside where do you start? I love watching youtube videos
            (and if you remember when Makemebad35 was in the top 10 creators around 2010-2012 I prey for our sanity) but
            having been around youtube for so long and seeing streaming platforms start to pop up everywhere I decided
            I'd try streaming a game I really liked to play called Escape From Tarkov, which went suprisingly well,
            given I only streamed for about 7 months during that crazy virus that shut down the planet. I experimented
            with Blender by following a tutorial to animate a doughnut in 3d. One thing I've found difficult is using
            multiple applications in a workflow, but it helps to know the scope of what you're trying to acheive before
            you get too ambitious. For example, I wanted to make a game so I download blender to make a model for the
            game, at this point I don't know the game engine I'm using to create an asset, I don't even know how to make
            the model a game asset, so I'm just wasting my time aimlessly tutorial hopping.</p>

          <p>I have Attention Deficit Disorder, and sometimes I'll become side-tracked while making a plan and go all
            in. So, you're interested in making things? one might say, Developing things? you want to work with
            computers?
            "IT people work with computers, I should learn IT things!", so I buy myself a course that outlines the steps
            needed to gain the experience needed to start a job at a help desk. While not necessarily the worst idea
            ever, creating an Active directory, clearing DNS caches, typing ipconfig alot, remote networking between
            virtual and physical machines, and all that is interesting and cool in it's own right, and I'm more than
            happy to learn more about it when I need it. Interacting with data looks a bit more fun to me than changing
            passwords.</p>

          <p>After a few months of just doing tutorial after tutorial, and introducing myself to the concept of doing
            projects, as a means of gaining useful experience in the field I'm trying to find a carrer in, with the IT
            course. (in heindsight I shouldn't have paid for, free resources are plenty online) I
            discovered FreeCodeCamp, I've been following the courses in order and this has been a terrific source of
            information for me, and it has allowed me to code
            the website you're currently viewing. I hope my story shows that it can be chaotic trying to learn something
            new, but everytime you fail, you gain new foresight that can help you succeed. I know I mentioned wanting to
            make a game at one point, and I certinally will as a side-project in the future. this website is still in
            development :P</p>
